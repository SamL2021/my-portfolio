My nology portfolio project to showcase the skills learnt in my intensive tech training course.

I created a single page with multiple sections:

- A landing section with your name and title on it.
- An About section with a little bit about me
- A Tech stacks/skills section with all the techs you have learned (so far) during the course
- A Project section with all your projects (use placeholder images and text at the beginning to render your website as it would with actual projects) - each project should have a little description, a link to a live version and a link to the matching GitHub Repo 
- A Contact section with my mail, GitHub profile link and LinkedIn profile link

I used SCSS for styling and B.E.M as my naming convention. As Responsiveness is vital and many sites are viewed on mobile devices I built my site for mobile first and then modified for larger screen sizes where required. I hope to add even more features to my site as my capabilities grow.
